The second problem was that turrets were extremely heavy. Ericsson was able to offer the heaviest possible turret ( guns and armour protection ) by deliberately designing a ship with very low freeboard. The weight thus saved from having a high broadside above the waterline was diverted to actual guns and armour. Low freeboard, however, also meant a smaller hull and therefore a smaller capacity for coal storage \u2014 and therefore range of the vessel. In many respects, the turreted, low @-@ freeboard Monitor and the broadside sailer HMS Warrior represented two opposite extremes in what an'Ironclad'was all about. The most dramatic attempt to compromise these two extremes, or'squaring this circle ', was designed by Captain Cowper Phipps Coles : HMS Captain, a dangerously low freeboard turret ship which nevertheless carried a full rig of sail, and which subsequently capsized not long after her launch in 1870. Her half @-@ sister HMS Monarch was restricted to firing from her turrets only on the port and starboard beams. The third Royal Navy ship to combine turrets and masts was HMS Inflexible of 1876, which carried two turrets on either side of the centre @-@ line, allowing both to fire fore, aft and broadside.\n",

He believed he had been making a \" much more whimsical, [... ] kaleidoscopic \" film than what came together in the edit suite. Instead, Mendes was drawn to the emotion and darkness ; he began to use the score and shots he had intended to discard to craft the film along these lines. In total, he cut about 30 minutes from his original edit. The opening included a dream in which Lester imagines himself flying above the town. Mendes spent two days filming Spacey against bluescreen, but removed the sequence as he believed it to be too whimsical \u2014 \" like a Coen brothers movie \" \u2014 and therefore inappropriate for the tone he was trying to set. The opening in the final cut reused a scene from the middle of the film where Jane tells Ricky to kill her father. This scene was to be the revelation to the audience that the pair was not responsible for Lester's death, as the way it was scored and acted made it clear that Jane's request was not serious. However, in the portion he used in the opening \u2014 and when the full scene plays out later \u2014 Mendes used the score and a reaction shot of Ricky to leave a lingering ambiguity as to his guilt.
