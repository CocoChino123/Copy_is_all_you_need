Ericsson's turret turned on a central spindle, and Coles's turned on a ring of bearings. Turrets offered the maximum arc of fire from the guns, but there were significant problems with their use in the 1860s. The fire arc of a turret would be considerably limited by masts and rigging, so they were unsuited to use on the earlier ocean @-@ going ironclads. The second problem was that turrets were extremely heavy. Ericsson was able to offer the heaviest possible turret ( guns and armour protection ) by deliberately designing a ship with very low freeboard. The weight thus saved from having a high broadside above the waterline was diverted to actual guns and armour. Low freeboard, however, also meant a smaller hull and therefore a smaller capacity for coal storage \u2014 and therefore range of the vessel. In many respects, the turreted, low @-@ freeboard Monitor and the broadside sailer HMS Warrior represented two opposite extremes in what an'Ironclad'was all about.
