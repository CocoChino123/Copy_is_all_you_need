Red - tailed black cockatoos are highly social, breeding close to humans in many drier areas or displaying overlapping territorial displays. In 2004 a study of the time of breeding observed 34. 5 % cockatoos present in captivity, and in 2006 a study of cockatoos attributed to between 70 % and 82 % of their own immature birds.
